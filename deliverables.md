The following tools were recently created by our group:

* [Just Annotate My Genome (JAMg)](http://jamg.sourceforge.net): Genome structural feature annotation tool - for identifying genes.
* [Just Annotate My Proteins (JAMp)](http://jamps.sourceforge.net): Genome feature annotation tool - for inferring GO annotations.
* [GenSAS](http://gensas.bioinfo.wsu.edu): Integrates gene prediction and genome visualization tools into a single visual interface. 
* [GeneValidator](http://wurmlab.github.io/tools/genevalidator/): automated or visual identification of problematic gene predictions. 
* [Afra](http://afra.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk): crowdsourcing curation of gene predictions in the classroom.
