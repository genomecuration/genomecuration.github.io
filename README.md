# genomecuration.github.io

Building non-model species genome curation communities.

# How to populate

Within genometrain subdirectories

* `curated-collection`: for specific teaching materials we made/curated.
* `kitchen-sink`: for anything random (e.g. downlaoded elsewhere)
* `scripts`: scripts that we feel can be helpful 


For a `.md` page to be converted to HTML it needs to include the follwoing at the top: 

```
---
layout: page
title: Genome curation on emerging model species blablab
---
```


# Testing website

In root directory (i.e. this one), type `jekyll serve --watch`
